# 🎓 International Education Cost Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores the annual cost of education for international students in various countries, including tuition and living expenses. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, I conducted a visual analysis to compare the overall affordability and financial burden of studying abroad.

The project is aimed at identifying which countries are most expensive for students and where cost-saving opportunities exist.

## 📁 Dataset

A manually created dataset that includes:
- Country
- Tuition (USD)
- LivingCost (USD)
- TotalCost (USD)

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data visualization techniques

---

## ✅ What I Did

- Created a structured CSV dataset for 4 countries: USA, UK, Canada, Australia
- Calculated total costs for each country by combining tuition and living expenses
- Built bar charts using Seaborn to compare:
  - Total cost per country
  - Stacked bar for tuition vs living costs
- Customized chart colors to visually distinguish countries
- Summarized findings with markdown explanations

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- The USA has the highest total education cost among the selected countries.
- Canada is the most affordable option, primarily due to lower tuition and living costs.
- Australia’s cost is higher than the UK despite similar tuition, driven by higher living expenses.
